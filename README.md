# Robust Neural Machine Translation with Doubly Adversarial Inputs

Our #ACL2019 Review 4 from Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) holding in Florence, Italy is #AdvGen from @GoogleAI to reduce mistranslation rates by using generated adversarial examples to improve the stability of machine translation models against small perturbations in the input.
